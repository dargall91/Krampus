# Deliverable Information

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:**
> Bus Scheduling (#4)

**Sprint Number:**
> 3

**Scrum Master**:
> John Thurstonson

**Git Master**:
> Chris Boveda

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:**
> Our goal for Sprint 3 is to complete cosmetic improvements on the Bus Scheduling system and add dynamic mapping capability. We will also be using Static Analysis to improve code quality.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**
> Have added *X* stories to the product backlog.  We did not have any stories roll over from Sprint 2.

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**
> We added *X* stories to the sprint 3 backlog for a total of *X* points.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**
> We selected the user stories because they comprise the final requirements to deliver a working product to the customer.  We are using our experience with Sprints 1 and 2 to estimate our ability to complete all of the USs in Sprint 3.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**
> The stories for sprint 3 cover the remaining required UI changes for this product and meet the remaining customer requirements.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**
> Yes, our team has a complete understanding of what needs to be done for this sprint and feels confident.


## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

| Date  | Attendees  | Meeting notes | Burndown Info  | TravisCI info  | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14APR21 | All | Sprint2 retrospective and Sprint3 planning | n/a | n/a | via Slack/Zoom, no blockers |

### Meeting Summary:

| Name | Meeting Attended This Sprint | Sprint 2 | Sprint 1 | Project Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Brian Pape| 			6 | 5| 8| 19|
|Chris Boveda| 			5 | 5| 8| 18|
|Derek Argall| 			6 |5| 8| 19|
|John Thurstonson| 		6 |5| 7| 18|

**Note:** Attendance count is based on slack updates on the scheduled stand-up days. 


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [https://youtu.be/Hv-IImZZKg0](https://youtu.be/Hv-IImZZKg0)

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

>  The code that was implemented in this sprint is high quality, and was built on a foundation of quality code from previous sprints. 

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Our team worked enough, as evidenced by the 100% completion of our Sprint 3 user stories. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes, we met all of the customer's expectations. All of the requirements from the original prompt have been fulfilled, and the program is stable and usable.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we met our sprint goal -- the program has full functionality in an aesthetically pleasing interface, and the code base quality has been drastically improved.

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> Yes, we completed all of the stories in our sprint backlog. The burndown chart cuts off at 4/27 due to the end of the sprint settings in Taiga, but all of our work was completed before the final review and retrospective meeting on the 27th.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> n/a

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

>  While our burndown chart is not perfect, it is reasonably good given the context of finals and assignment workload, and considering that one of the user stories was worth over a quarter of the points in the sprint backlog.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, the software meets all of the customer requirements, is stable, and is easy to use.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> n/a

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Everyone on our team is very happy with our accomplishments over the course of the project. Emphasizing the need for quality code from the beginning, as detailed in our quality policy, helped to lay the foundation for a successful and efficient workflow.

### Contributions:
