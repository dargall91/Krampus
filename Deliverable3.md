# Deliverable Information

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:**
> Bus Scheduling (#4)

**Sprint Number:**
> 3

**Scrum Master**:
> John Thurstonson

**Git Master**:
> Chris Boveda

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:**
> Our goal for Sprint 3 is to complete cosmetic improvements on the Bus Scheduling system and add dynamic mapping capability. We will also be using Static Analysis to improve code quality.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**
> Have added *X* stories to the product backlog.  We did not have any stories roll over from Sprint 2.

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**
> We added *X* stories to the sprint 3 backlog for a total of *X* points.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**
> We selected the user stories because they comprise the final requirements to deliver a working product to the customer.  We are using our experience with Sprints 1 and 2 to estimate our ability to complete all of the USs in Sprint 3.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**
> The stories for sprint 3 cover the remaining required UI changes for this product and meet the remaining customer requirements.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**
> Yes, our team has a complete understanding of what needs to be done for this sprint and feels confident.


## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

| Date  | Attendees  | Meeting notes | Burndown Info  | TravisCI info  | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14APR21 | All | Sprint2 retrospective and Sprint3 planning | n/a | n/a | via Slack/Zoom, no blockers |

### Meeting Summary:

| Name | Meeting Attended This Sprint | Sprint 2 | Sprint 1 | Project Total |

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [https://youtu.be/Hv-IImZZKg0](https://youtu.be/Hv-IImZZKg0)

>

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

>

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

>

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

>


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> 

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> 

**If not, what went wrong?**

>

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

>  

**Did you deliver business value?**

> 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> 

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

>
