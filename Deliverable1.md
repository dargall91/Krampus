### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 
> Our goal for Sprint 1 is to gain a more thorough understanding of the existing Memoranda system, resolve some critical bugs in the existing system, and lay the foundation for future changes.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**
> We added 9 stories from the example Taiga board, and 8 additional stories that we developed ourselves.

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> We added the 7 stories from the example Taiga board Sprint 1, and 3 stories that we developed ourselves.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**
> We believe that we can complete all of the stories we have added. In addition to ensuring that the original requirements are met, we also wanted to build a foundation of the potential dependencies for future stories.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**
> These stories fit our sprint goal well, and follow the theme of setting up for future success.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**
> Yes, each of our team members confirmed in our pre-sprint standup that they have a rough idea of what needs to be done. 



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."
