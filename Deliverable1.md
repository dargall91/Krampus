# Deliverable Information

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** 
> Bus Scheduling (#4)

**Sprint Number:** 
> 1

**Scrum Master**: 
> Chris Boveda

**Git Master**: 
> Kevin Dolan

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 
> Our goal for Sprint 1 is to gain a more thorough understanding of the existing Memoranda system, resolve some critical bugs in the existing system, and lay the foundation for future changes.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**
> We added 9 stories from the example Taiga board, and 8 additional stories that we developed ourselves.

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> We added the 7 stories from the example Taiga board Sprint 1, and 3 stories that we developed ourselves.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**
> We believe that we can complete all of the stories we have added. In addition to ensuring that the original requirements are met, we also wanted to build a foundation of the potential dependencies for future stories.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**
> These stories fit our sprint goal well, and follow the theme of setting up for future success.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**
> Yes, each of our team members confirmed in our pre-sprint standup that they have a rough idea of what needs to be done. 



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We resolved many of the critical bugs in the existing memoranda software, laid the foundation for the data structures that will be used in the bus scheduling system, and through our UI mockups started a plan for implementation of the bus system.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Yes, as a whole our team felt that we worked enough and did what was expected of us. Our intial estimation of the workload was below what we were capable of competing, and we pulled in one additional story from the product backlog.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes, we completed all but one of the prescribed user stories, and the user story that will be rolling over in to Sprint 2 is part of our larger implementation plan for the UI.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, our team met our sprint goal.

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> No, we did not complete all of our stories on our sprint backlog. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> While most of our user stories related to the UI were focused on mockups and planning, user story 50 included acceptance criteria related to implementation. The planning tasks of US50 were completed, but the implementation was not completed in time for the end of the sprint.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Yes; our burndown chart showed a consistent rate of task and story completion throughout the sprint.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes; though the conversion from memoranda to the bus scheduling system is not readily apparent yet, we are ending sprint 1 with a great foundation for those future changes.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Our team agrees that we could do a better job of estimating the story points better.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Our team is optimistic and confident that we can complete the overall goal of converting memoranda to a bus scheduling system by the end of the three sprints.
